# Kenwood TH-D72A support scripts 

Scripts I've found useful for the TH-D72A, by Kenwood for packet operations.  Most of these
should be applicable to the D72E as well.

Script listing:

|Script Name|Description|
|-----|-----|
|tnc_up|Brings up a ax.25 interface, with IP|
|tnc_down|Bring the ax.25 interface down|
